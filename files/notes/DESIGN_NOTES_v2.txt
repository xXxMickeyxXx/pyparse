__________DESIGN NOTES FOR FINAL 'pyparse' DESIGN (as of 2024-08-16)__________
	NOTE: working off of the 'final_redesign' branch for 'pyparse' repo


	PARSER RUNTIME OVERVIEW:

		STEP 1: Parser initializes it's parsing state, which includes initializing it's associated
				'Grammar'


	PACKAGE COMPONENTS:

		• COMPONENT NAME: 		'ParseContext'
			- DESCRIPTION:      Represents a parser request, to parse a specifc input stream (which can
						   		be streamed or exist all upfront). Each unique input/input stream correlates
						   		with a single instance of 'ParseContext'.	
			- RESPONSIBILITIES: Manage the state the parser in relation to a given input/input stream

		
		• COMPONENT NAME: 		'InputStream'
			- DESCRIPTION: 		Represents the input, in it's raw form, that will be consumed by the
								the parsing system. 
			- RESPONSIBILITIES:	Contains and manages a given input/input stream. Each instance of
								'ParseContext' will contain, at most, one
								instance of this class.


		• COMPONENT NAME: 		'Grammar'
			- DESCRIPTION: 		A collection of grammar rules ('GrammarRule') making up the defined language
								that the parser uses to interpret the 'InputStream'

	NOTE: this is the code which would receive the parser input, i.e.
		  the data which will be parsed, and then invokes the parser
