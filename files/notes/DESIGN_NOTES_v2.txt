__________DESIGN NOTES FOR FINAL 'pyparse' DESIGN (as of 2024-08-16)__________

(NOTE: working off of the 'final_redesign' branch for 'pyparse' repo)


PARSER RUNTIME OVERVIEW:

	STEP 1: Parser initializes it's parsing state, which includes initializing it's associated
			'Grammar'


PACKAGE COMPONENTS:

	• COMPONENT NAME: 		'ParseContext'
		- DESCRIPTION:      Represents a parser request, to parse a specifc input stream (which can
					   		be streamed or exist all upfront). Each unique input/input stream correlates
					   		with a single instance of 'ParseContext'.	
		- RESPONSIBILITIES: Manage the state the parser in relation to a given input/input stream

	
	• COMPONENT NAME: 		'InputStream'
		- DESCRIPTION: 		Represents the input, in it's raw form, that will be consumed by the
							the parsing system. 
		- RESPONSIBILITIES:	Contains and manages a given input/input stream. Each instance of
							'ParseContext' will contain, at most, one
							instance of this class.


	• COMPONENT NAME: 		'Grammar'
		- DESCRIPTION: 		A collection of grammar rules ('GrammarRule') making up the defined language
							that the parser uses to interpret the 'InputStream'
