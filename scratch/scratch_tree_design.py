# TODO: create some sort of empty, abstract, builder/product like design whereby
# 		either the parse tree is actually constructed (during the parse) or when
# 		consuming the parse tree (to take further action, whatever that may be)
# 		In other words, it should be a shell of some sort that is easily malleable
# 		so that this lib can depend up on it to the degree that it doesn't exceed
# 		cohesion -- (NOTE: need to figure out how light-weight the design should
# 		be or if it should be bulky, with maybe choosing a different place to
#		trim any sort of 'fat', so to speak)
